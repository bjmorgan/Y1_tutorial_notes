# About these notes {-}

These notes accompany the tutorial questions for Y1 Physical Chemistry at the University of Bath. They are intended to help you understand the *chemistry* behind the calculations---what is physically happening, and why. Throughout these notes, the emphasis is on thinking through each problem before reaching for an equation.

These notes are not a replacement for the tutorial itself, nor for your lecture notes. They are a companion resource, designed to be read alongside the tutorial questions.
