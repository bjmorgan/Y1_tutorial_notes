This is true at 25 °C, but it is not a general rule. To understand why, we need to think about what is actually happening in liquid water. 1.1.1 The autoionisation of water Water molecules constantly react with each other: \\[\\ce{2H2O &lt;=&gt; H3O+ + OH-}\\] This is an equilibrium, and like all equilibria it is described by an equilibrium constant: \\[K_\\mathrm{w} = [\\ce{H+}][\\ce{OH-}]\\] At 25 °C, \\(K_\\mathrm{w} = 10^{-14}\\). This equilibrium lies very far to the left: only a tiny fraction of water molecules are ionised at any instant. But it is always there, and it is the reason that pure water contains any \\(\\ce{H+}\\) or \\(\\ce{OH-}\\) at all. 1.1.2 Why does \\(K_\\mathrm{w}\\) change with temperature? The autoionisation is endothermic (\\(\\Delta H &gt; 0\\)): it costs energy to break an \\(\\ce{O-H}\\) bond and separate charge. By Le Chatelier’s principle, raising the temperature shifts an endothermic equilibrium to the right. So at higher temperatures, more water molecules dissociate, and \\(K_\\mathrm{w}\\) gets larger. At 100 °C, \\(\\mathrm{p}K_\\mathrm{w} \\approx 12\\), meaning \\(K_\\mathrm{w} \\approx 10^{-12}\\). This is 100 times larger than at 25 °C, so there really is more \\(\\ce{H+}\\) and more \\(\\ce{OH-}\\) in hot water. 1.1.3 What does “neutral” actually mean? Think about what we mean physically. In pure water, every \\(\\ce{H+}\\) ion is produced alongside an \\(\\ce{OH-}\\) ion (they come from the same autoionisation reaction). There is no other source of either ion. So in pure water, \\([\\ce{H+}] = [\\ce{OH-}]\\), always, at any temperature. A neutral solution is one where \\([\\ce{H+}] = [\\ce{OH-}]\\). That is the definition of neutrality. It is not defined as pH \\(= 7\\). Since \\([\\ce{H+}] = [\\ce{OH-}]\\) and \\([\\ce{H+}][\\ce{OH-}] = K_\\mathrm{w}\\), we can write: \\[[\\ce{H+}]^2 = K_\\mathrm{w}, \\qquad [\\ce{H+}] = \\sqrt{K_\\mathrm{w}}, \\qquad \\text{pH} = \\frac{\\mathrm{p}K_\\mathrm{w}}{2}\\] At 25 °C: \\(\\text{pH} = 14/2 = 7\\). At 100 °C: \\(\\text{pH} = 12/2 = 6\\). Boiling water has pH 6, but it is perfectly neutral. There is equal \\(\\ce{H+}\\) and \\(\\ce{OH-}\\). There is just more of both, because the endothermic autoionisation is favoured at higher temperature. Note on the calculation: If we are told only \\(K_\\mathrm{w}\\), we need to assume neutrality (\\([\\ce{H+}] = [\\ce{OH-}]\\)) in order to calculate a pH. Without this assumption, we only know the product \\([\\ce{H+}][\\ce{OH-}]\\), not the individual concentrations. For pure water this assumption is justified; for a solution containing an acid or base, it would not be. 1.2 Buffer solutions 1.2.1 What is in a buffer solution? Consider a buffer made from 0.1 mol of acetic acid (\\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\\), a weak acid, which we abbreviate \\(\\ce{HA}\\)) and 0.1 mol of sodium acetate (\\(\\ce{CH3COONa}\\)), dissolved in 1 L of water. Before thinking about any equations, let us think about what is physically present in the solution: The acetic acid (\\(\\ce{HA}\\)) is a weak acid. It does not fully dissociate. The equilibrium \\(\\ce{HA &lt;=&gt; H+ + A-}\\) lies well to the left (\\(K_\\mathrm{a} \\sim 10^{-5}\\)). So most of the acetic acid sits in solution as intact \\(\\ce{HA}\\) molecules. The sodium acetate is a salt. It dissociates completely: \\(\\ce{CH3COONa -&gt; Na+ + CH3COO-}\\). The \\(\\ce{Na+}\\) is a spectator ion; it plays no further role. The \\(\\ce{CH3COO-}\\) (which we call \\(\\ce{A-}\\)) is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So we have deliberately placed both \\(\\ce{HA}\\) and \\(\\ce{A-}\\) into the solution, each at a known concentration. This is the essential feature of a buffer: a reservoir of weak acid and its conjugate base, both present in significant amounts. Why doesn’t the \\(\\ce{A-}\\) just react with water to form \\(\\ce{HA}\\)? It does, partially. The system reaches equilibrium, but \\(K_\\mathrm{a} \\sim 10^{-5}\\) means the equilibrium concentration of \\(\\ce{H+}\\) is tiny (\\(\\sim 10^{-5}\\) M). The amount of \\(\\ce{A-}\\) that converts to \\(\\ce{HA}\\) is negligible compared to the 0.1 mol we put in. When the buffer concentrations (\\(\\sim 0.1\\) M) are huge compared to \\(K_\\mathrm{a}\\) (\\(\\sim 10^{-5}\\)), the stoichiometric amounts we put in are an excellent approximation to the equilibrium amounts. 1.2.2 Why does a buffer resist pH changes? The key idea is that the buffer has chemical reservoirs that can neutralise added acid or base. Adding acid: Suppose you add a small amount of strong acid (say \\(\\ce{HCl}\\)). The \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) dissociates completely, releasing \\(\\ce{H+}\\) ions. But these \\(\\ce{H+}\\) ions do not simply accumulate in solution. The conjugate base \\(\\ce{A-}\\) reacts with them: \\[\\ce{H+ + A- -&gt; HA}\\] The \\(\\ce{A-}\\) “mops up” the added \\(\\ce{H+}\\), converting it into undissociated \\(\\ce{HA}\\). Why does this happen? Because \\(K_\\mathrm{a}\\) is small (\\(\\sim 10^{-5}\\)), the equilibrium \\(\\ce{HA &lt;=&gt; H+ + A-}\\) strongly favours the left-hand side. Adding \\(\\ce{H+}\\) pushes the equilibrium even further to the left (Le Chatelier), so the reaction goes essentially to completion. The result: the amount of free \\(\\ce{H+}\\) barely changes. Instead, you have slightly less \\(\\ce{A-}\\) and slightly more \\(\\ce{HA}\\). Adding base: If you add \\(\\ce{OH-}\\) instead, the weak acid neutralises it: \\[\\ce{OH- + HA -&gt; A- + H2O}\\] Now you have slightly less \\(\\ce{HA}\\) and slightly more \\(\\ce{A-}\\), but the pH barely changes. A buffer works because the conjugate base mops up added \\(\\ce{H+}\\), and the weak acid neutralises added \\(\\ce{OH-}\\). The buffer is overwhelmed only when you run out of one of these reservoirs. 1.2.3 The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation This is not a new equation to memorise. It is simply the \\(K_\\mathrm{a}\\) expression, rearranged: \\[K_\\mathrm{a} = \\frac{[\\ce{H+}][\\ce{A-}]}{[\\ce{HA}]}\\] \\[[\\ce{H+}] = K_\\mathrm{a}\\,\\frac{[\\ce{HA}]}{[\\ce{A-}]}\\] \\[\\text{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_\\mathrm{a} + \\log\\!\\left(\\frac{[\\ce{A-}]}{[\\ce{HA}]}\\right)\\] When \\([\\ce{A-}] = [\\ce{HA}]\\), the log term vanishes and \\(\\text{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_\\mathrm{a}\\). This is the optimal buffer: you have equal amounts of acid and base available, so you are equally well prepared for added acid or added base. 1.2.4 Thinking through a buffer problem Rather than blindly plugging into the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, it is better to think step by step about what happens physically. Consider adding 0.01 mol of \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) to 1 L of the acetic acid buffer described above: \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) dissociates completely (it is a strong acid): \\(\\ce{HCl -&gt; H+ + Cl-}\\). We now have 0.01 mol of extra \\(\\ce{H+}\\). The conjugate base mops up the \\(\\ce{H+}\\): The \\(\\ce{A-}\\) reacts with the added \\(\\ce{H+}\\) to form \\(\\ce{HA}\\), and this goes essentially to completion (because \\(K_\\mathrm{a}\\) is small). So 0.01 mol of \\(\\ce{A-}\\) is consumed, and 0.01 mol of \\(\\ce{HA}\\) is produced. Work out the new concentrations: \\[\\begin{align*} [\\ce{A-}] &amp;= 0.10 - 0.01 = 0.09~\\text{M} \\\\ [\\ce{HA}] &amp;= 0.10 + 0.01 = 0.11~\\text{M} \\end{align*}\\] Now use Henderson–Hasselbalch: \\[\\text{pH} = 4.756 + \\log\\!\\left(\\frac{0.09}{0.11}\\right) = 4.756 - 0.087 = 4.669\\] The pH has shifted by less than 0.1 units, despite adding a significant amount of strong acid. Compare: adding 0.01 mol of \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) to 1 L of pure water would give \\(\\text{pH} \\approx 2\\). 1.2.5 The stoichiometric approximation In Step 3 above, we used the stoichiometric concentrations (0.09 and 0.11 M) as though they were the true equilibrium concentrations. Strictly, a tiny amount of the \\(\\ce{HA}\\) will dissociate back to \\(\\ce{H+}\\) and \\(\\ce{A-}\\) at equilibrium. To get the exact answer you would need to solve a quadratic. But because \\(K_\\mathrm{a}\\) (\\(\\sim 10^{-5}\\)) is so much smaller than the buffer concentrations (\\(\\sim 0.1\\) M), the equilibrium shift is negligible. This is why buffer problems typically say “estimate the pH”: we are making a deliberate, physically justified approximation. 1.3 Activity and ionic strength 1.3.1 The problem with concentrations Up to this point we have been using concentrations directly in our equilibrium expressions: \\(K_\\mathrm{a} = [\\ce{H+}][\\ce{A-}]/[\\ce{HA}]\\), \\(K_\\mathrm{w} = [\\ce{H+}][\\ce{OH-}]\\), and so on. This works well for dilute solutions of uncharged molecules. But for ions, there is a problem. 1.3.2 The ionic atmosphere: a physical picture In an ionic solution, every ion is surrounded by other ions. Electrostatics dictates that oppositely charged ions tend to cluster nearby: a positive ion will, on average, have slightly more negative ions in its vicinity than positive ones. This surrounding cloud of (predominantly) opposite charge is called the ionic atmosphere. The ionic atmosphere partially stabilises the central ion. Think of it this way: the ion sits in a favourable electrostatic environment, a potential energy well created by the surrounding charges. To participate in a chemical reaction, the ion would need to leave this stabilising environment. There is an energetic cost to doing so. The practical consequence is that a stabilised ion is less reactive than a free ion would be. An \\(\\ce{H+}\\) ion surrounded by its ionic atmosphere is less available to react with a base, donate to a proton transfer, or do anything else chemical. It behaves as though its concentration were lower than it actually is. The ionic atmosphere stabilises ions in solution. A more stabilised ion has a greater energetic cost to participate in chemistry, so it behaves as though its concentration is lower than it really is. 1.3.3 Activity: quantifying the effect We formalise this using the concept of activity. The activity of an ion is its “effective concentration”: the concentration it appears to have, based on its chemical behaviour: \\[a = \\gamma \\, c\\] where \\(c\\) is the actual (stoichiometric) concentration and \\(\\gamma\\) is the activity coefficient. In an ideal (very dilute) solution: \\(\\gamma = 1\\), so \\(a = c\\) and concentrations work fine. In a real solution with significant ion–ion interactions: \\(\\gamma &lt; 1\\), so \\(a &lt; c\\). The ion is “less active” than its concentration suggests. For pH, this means we should really write: \\[\\text{pH} = -\\log(a_{\\ce{H+}}) = -\\log(\\gamma\\,[\\ce{H+}])\\] A lower \\(\\gamma\\) gives a higher pH (less acidic) than the concentration alone would predict. 1.3.4 Ionic strength: what controls the ionic atmosphere? The strength of the ionic atmosphere depends on two things: how many ions are nearby, and how charged they are. A doubly-charged ion creates a much stronger electrostatic field than a singly-charged one, and therefore contributes more to the ionic atmosphere of every other ion in the solution. This is quantified by the ionic strength, \\(I\\): \\[I = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i c_i\\,z_i^2\\] where the sum runs over all ions, \\(c_i\\) is the concentration of ion \\(i\\), and \\(z_i\\) is its charge. Notice the \\(z_i^2\\) weighting: a \\(\\ce{SO4^{2-}}\\) ion contributes four times as much to the ionic strength as a \\(\\ce{Cl-}\\) ion at the same concentration, because \\((2)^2 = 4\\) versus \\((1)^2 = 1\\). This reflects the physical reality that a more highly charged ion has a stronger electrostatic effect on its surroundings. 1.3.5 The Debye–Hückel limiting law The Debye–Hückel limiting law gives us a quantitative estimate of how much the ionic atmosphere reduces \\(\\gamma\\): \\[\\log\\gamma_{\\pm} = -0.509\\,|z_+\\,z_-|\\,\\sqrt{I}\\] This equation encodes the physics we have been discussing: Higher ionic strength \\(\\to\\) smaller \\(\\gamma\\): More ions means a denser ionic atmosphere, which stabilises each ion more, making it less chemically active. Higher charges \\(\\to\\) smaller \\(\\gamma\\): More highly charged ions interact more strongly, so the stabilisation effect is larger. \\(\\sqrt{I}\\) dependence: This comes from the physics of electrostatic screening (the Debye screening length scales as \\(1/\\sqrt{I}\\)). The equation is valid for dilute solutions (\\(I \\lesssim 0.01\\) M). At higher concentrations, the simple model breaks down and more sophisticated theories are needed. 1.3.6 Example: why do HCl and H2SO4 differ? Consider 0.01 M \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) and 0.005 M \\(\\ce{H2SO4}\\). Ideally, both produce \\([\\ce{H+}] = 0.01\\) M and pH \\(= 2\\). But in reality, the \\(\\ce{H2SO4}\\) solution has a slightly higher pH (is less acidic). Why? Stronger ionic atmosphere: \\(\\ce{H2SO4}\\) contains the doubly-charged \\(\\ce{SO4^{2-}}\\) ion, which contributes more to the ionic strength (\\(I = 0.015\\) M) than the singly-charged \\(\\ce{Cl-}\\) in \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) (\\(I = 0.01\\) M). A higher ionic strength means a stronger ionic atmosphere, a smaller \\(\\gamma\\), and therefore a higher pH. Incomplete dissociation: \\(\\ce{H2SO4}\\) is dibasic. The first proton comes off completely, but the second does not. The solution contains a mixture of \\(\\ce{HSO4-}\\) and \\(\\ce{SO4^{2-}}\\). So there are fewer free \\(\\ce{H+}\\) ions than the ideal calculation predicts. 1.3.7 Worked example: applying the Debye–Hückel limiting law Let us put numbers to the ionic atmosphere effect for 0.01 M \\(\\ce{HCl}\\). Identify the ions and their charges. \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) dissociates completely: \\([\\ce{H+}] = [\\ce{Cl-}] = 0.01\\) M, with charges \\(z_+ = +1\\) and \\(z_- = -1\\). Calculate the ionic strength. \\[I = \\tfrac{1}{2}(0.01 \\times 1^2 + 0.01 \\times 1^2) = 0.01~\\text{M}\\] Apply the Debye–Hückel limiting law. \\[\\log\\gamma = -0.509 \\times |{+1} \\times {-1}| \\times \\sqrt{0.01} = -0.509 \\times 1 \\times 0.1 = -0.0509\\] Find \\(\\gamma\\). \\[\\gamma = 10^{-0.0509} = 0.889\\] The activity of \\(\\ce{H+}\\) is about 89% of its concentration. The ionic atmosphere reduces its effective concentration by about 11%. Calculate the pH. \\[\\text{pH} = -\\log(\\gamma \\times [\\ce{H+}]) = -\\log(0.889 \\times 0.01) = -\\log(0.00889) = 2.051\\] This is slightly higher than the ideal pH of 2.000, as we expected: the ionic atmosphere stabilises the \\(\\ce{H+}\\), making it less active. Shortcut: Since \\(\\text{pH} = -\\log\\gamma - \\log[\\ce{H+}] = -\\log\\gamma + 2\\), the correction to pH is simply \\(-\\log\\gamma = 0.051\\). So \\(\\text{pH} = 2 + 0.051 = 2.051\\). 1.4 Osmotic pressure and PBS 1.4.1 What is osmotic pressure? When a solution is separated from pure solvent by a semi-permeable membrane (one that lets solvent through but not solute), solvent flows into the solution by osmosis. The osmotic pressure \\(\\Pi\\) is the pressure you would need to apply to the solution to stop this flow. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property: it depends only on the total number of dissolved particles, not on their identity, charge, or mass. Every dissolved ion or molecule contributes equally. The osmotic pressure is: \\[\\Pi = cRT\\] where \\(c\\) is the total concentration of all dissolved species. Use the total particle concentration for osmotic pressure, not the ionic strength. Ionic strength weights by charge squared; it measures the electrostatic environment. Osmotic pressure just counts particles. This is a common source of error. A note on the van ’t Hoff factor. Some textbooks write the osmotic pressure as \\(\\Pi = iMRT\\), where \\(M\\) is the formula concentration of the salt (e.g. 0.135 M for \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\)) and \\(i\\) is the van ’t Hoff factor, the number of ions produced per formula unit (\\(i = 2\\) for \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\), \\(i = 3\\) for \\(\\ce{Na2HPO4}\\), etc.). This is equivalent to what we are doing: if you have already counted all the individual ions and added up their concentrations to get \\(c\\), you do not need \\(i\\) because it is already accounted for. The two approaches give the same answer. 1.4.2 Why does this matter? Isotonicity Osmotic pressure is critically important in biology. Cell membranes are semi-permeable, so if you place a cell in a solution with the wrong osmotic pressure, water flows across the membrane: Too dilute (hypotonic): water flows into the cell, it swells and may burst (lysis). Too concentrated (hypertonic): water flows out of the cell, it shrivels (crenation). A solution with the same osmotic pressure as body fluids is called isotonic. This is why medical solutions like Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) are carefully formulated to match the osmotic pressure of blood (\\(\\sim 800\\) kPa at body temperature). The phosphate component also acts as a pH buffer near physiological pH (\\(\\sim 7.4\\)). 1.5 Electrochemical cells 1.5.1 The physical setup An electrochemical cell consists of two half cells, each containing a chemical species that can gain or lose electrons. The half cells are connected by: A wire (external circuit): electrons flow through this from one electrode to the other. A salt bridge: ions flow through this to maintain electrical neutrality in each half cell. The key physical idea is that the oxidation and reduction are separated in space. Instead of the electron transfer happening directly between the reactants (as it would if you dropped iron into acid), the electrons are forced to travel through the external circuit, where we can measure a voltage or extract useful work. 1.5.2 Cell notation The cell is written as: \\[\\text{left electrode} \\mid \\text{left solution} \\| \\text{right solution} \\mid \\text{right electrode}\\] \\(\\mid\\) = phase boundary (solid/liquid, liquid/gas, etc.) \\(\\|\\) = salt bridge Commas separate species in the same phase. 1.5.3 Reduction potentials: what do they mean? Each half cell has a standard reduction potential \\(E^\\circ\\), listed in data tables. These are written as reduction reactions by convention: \\[\\text{Oxidised form} + n\\,\\ce{e-} \\longrightarrow \\text{Reduced form}\\] What does the number mean physically? A more positive \\(E^\\circ\\) means the species has a stronger tendency to gain electrons (be reduced). A more negative \\(E^\\circ\\) means it would rather lose electrons (be oxidised). These are the same reactions that occur in the half cells, and they can run in either direction. The data table writes them as reductions by convention, but in a real cell one half cell will run as a reduction and the other will run in reverse (as an oxidation). Which way round? The cell potential tells us. 1.5.4 Calculating the cell potential This is the central calculation, and it is simple: \\[E_\\text{cell} = E^\\circ(\\text{RHS}) - E^\\circ(\\text{LHS})\\] Use the reduction potentials directly from the table. There is no need to flip any reactions or change the sign of any potential. Just subtract: right minus left. The sign of \\(E_\\text{cell}\\) tells you the direction of spontaneous reaction: \\(E_\\text{cell} &gt; 0\\): the reaction proceeds spontaneously as written (left to right). Electrons flow from the left electrode to the right through the external circuit. \\(E_\\text{cell} &lt; 0\\): the spontaneous direction is the reverse. 1.5.5 Anode and cathode The anode is the electrode where oxidation occurs (electrons are released). The cathode is the electrode where reduction occurs (electrons are consumed). One approach to electrochemistry problems is to assign the anode and cathode at the start, using a memorised convention, and then work through the problem from there. This works, but it does rely on remembering the convention correctly, and on the question following the same convention you learnt. An alternative is to let the physics do the work for you. The cell potential \\(E_\\text{cell}\\) tells you, unambiguously, which direction the electrons flow. This tells you where oxidation and reduction occur, which in turn tells you which electrode is the anode and which is the cathode. You do need to remember what “anode” and “cathode” mean, but you do not need to memorise which electrode is which in advance. The physics tells you that. Calculate \\(E_\\text{cell}\\) first. This tells you the direction of electron flow, and therefore where oxidation and reduction occur. The anode and cathode labels then follow from the definitions. 1.5.6 Stoichiometry and \\(\\Delta G\\) To write the balanced overall reaction, you need to multiply the half reactions so that the number of electrons cancels. Getting the stoichiometry right matters, because it determines \\(n\\), the number of electrons transferred, which you need for \\(\\Delta G\\). However, the cell potential \\(E\\) itself does not change when you multiply a half reaction. Why not? Because \\(E\\) is an intensive property: it is the energy per electron transferred. Just as doubling the amount of water in a beaker does not change its temperature, doubling the stoichiometry does not change the voltage. The Gibbs free energy change, on the other hand, is extensive, and scales with the amount of material: \\[\\Delta G = -nFE\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the balanced reaction, and \\(F = 96500~\\text{C mol}^{-1}\\) is Faraday’s constant. If you double the stoichiometry, \\(n\\) doubles, and \\(\\Delta G\\) doubles. This makes physical sense: reacting twice as much material releases twice as much energy. So: stoichiometry matters for the overall reaction and for \\(\\Delta G\\), but not for \\(E\\). 1.6 From cell potential to mass: Faraday’s law If a galvanic cell is connected to an external circuit with some resistance, electrons flow and we can work out exactly how much material reacts. The reasoning is a chain of simple steps, each using a single physical law or definition: Cell potential \\(\\to\\) current (Ohm’s law): \\[I = \\frac{V}{R}\\] The cell potential \\(V\\) drives a current \\(I\\) through the external resistance \\(R\\). An amp is a coulomb per second, so this tells you the rate at which charge flows. Current \\(\\to\\) total charge (definition of current): \\[Q = I \\times t\\] If the current flows for time \\(t\\), the total charge that has passed through the circuit is \\(Q\\). Charge \\(\\to\\) moles of electrons (Faraday’s constant): \\[\\text{moles of electrons} = \\frac{Q}{F}\\] Faraday’s constant \\(F = 96500~\\text{C mol}^{-1}\\) is the charge carried by one mole of electrons. So dividing the total charge by \\(F\\) gives the number of moles of electrons that have flowed. Moles of electrons \\(\\to\\) moles of substance (stoichiometry): \\[\\text{moles of substance} = \\frac{\\text{moles of electrons}}{n}\\] Here \\(n\\) comes directly from the half-reaction. For example, \\(\\ce{Fe -&gt; Fe^{2+} + 2e-}\\) has \\(n = 2\\): each iron atom releases 2 electrons, so you need 2 moles of electrons to dissolve 1 mole of iron. Moles \\(\\to\\) mass (molar mass): Multiply by the molar mass to get the answer in grams. The logic is completely linear: \\[\\text{voltage} \\longrightarrow \\text{current} \\longrightarrow \\text{charge} \\longrightarrow \\text{moles of } e^- \\longrightarrow \\text{moles} \\longrightarrow \\text{mass}\\] Each step uses one definition or law. If you understand what each quantity means physically, you can reconstruct this chain from scratch rather than memorising a formula. 1.6.1 Assumptions to be aware of Real galvanic cells are more complicated than this simple chain suggests. Some assumptions we are making: No internal resistance: We assumed all the resistance is in the external circuit. In reality, the solution has some resistance too. Ions moving through solution have to push past solvent molecules, which impedes the flow of charge. This would reduce the current. Constant voltage: As the reaction proceeds, the concentrations change, which changes the cell potential. We assumed the reaction time is short enough that this effect is negligible. (A more complete treatment uses the Nernst equation.) Ideal solution: We used standard reduction potentials, which assume all activities are 1. In a real solution, activity coefficients would slightly alter the voltage (as discussed in Section 1).

There are two kinds: A gross selection rule is about the molecule itself: what property must it have to interact with radiation at all? A specific selection rule is about the transition: which changes in quantum number are allowed? 2.1.1 The gross selection rule for rotational spectroscopy For a molecule to absorb microwave radiation and change its rotational state, it must have a permanent electric dipole moment. Why? Think about what happens when a polar molecule rotates. An observer at a fixed point sees the dipole swinging around, which looks like an oscillating electric field. This oscillating field can couple to the oscillating electric field of the incoming radiation, allowing energy transfer. A molecule with no dipole produces no oscillating field as it rotates, so there is nothing for the radiation to interact with. A molecule is rotationally active (absorbs/emits microwave radiation) if and only if it has a permanent electric dipole moment. This is the gross selection rule for rotational spectroscopy. 2.1.2 The specific selection rule: \\(\\Delta J = \\pm 1\\) You already know that a photon carries a quantum of energy (\\(E = h\\nu\\)) and a quantum of linear momentum (\\(p = h/\\lambda\\)). The same pattern extends to angular momentum: a photon carries exactly one unit of angular momentum. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it gains the photon’s angular momentum. Conservation of angular momentum then requires the molecule’s rotational quantum number to increase by exactly one: \\(\\Delta J = +1\\). Similarly, emission gives \\(\\Delta J = -1\\). The specific selection rule for rotational spectroscopy is \\(\\Delta J = \\pm 1\\). This follows from conservation of angular momentum: each photon carries one unit of angular momentum, so the molecule can only gain or lose one rotational quantum at a time. 2.1.3 Selection rules for vibrational spectroscopy (a comparison) The gross selection rule for vibrational spectroscopy has the same kind of physical argument: the electric dipole moment of the molecule must change during the vibration. A vibration that modulates the dipole produces an oscillating electric field that can couple to radiation, just as a rotating dipole does. The specific selection rule (\\(\\Delta v = \\pm 1\\) in the harmonic approximation) does not have such a neat physical justification. It comes from the mathematical properties of the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions, which you will meet when you study quantum mechanics. For now, it is enough to note the contrast: for rotation, both selection rules can be understood from physical arguments; for vibration, only the gross one can. 2.2 Molecular polarity and rotational activity The gross selection rule means you need to be able to determine whether a molecule has a permanent dipole. This requires thinking about molecular geometry, not just about whether individual bonds are polar. Consider a few cases: CO: one polar bond, so the molecule has a dipole. Straightforward. CO2: two polar C=O bonds, but the molecule is linear and symmetric. The two bond dipoles point in opposite directions and cancel exactly. No molecular dipole, so CO2 is rotationally inactive. CH4: the C–H bonds are slightly polar, and a flat drawing of methane can make it look like three bonds point one way and the fourth points another. But methane is tetrahedral. One way to see the symmetry is to place the carbon at the centre of a cube, with hydrogens at four alternating corners. The top face of the cube has two C–H bonds; the bottom face has the other two. Both pairs are equivalent, so the molecule is perfectly balanced. No net dipole. Note that “heteronuclear” (containing different elements) is not the same as “has a permanent dipole.” For diatomic molecules, all heteronuclear diatomics do have a dipole, so the shortcut works. But for polyatomic molecules it breaks down: CH4 contains two different elements but has no dipole (tetrahedral symmetry), while NH3 and CH2Cl2 both have dipoles despite being neither diatomic nor simple. The selection rule is always about the dipole, not the atomic composition. Polar bonds do not guarantee a polar molecule. You need to consider the molecular geometry: if the bond dipoles cancel by symmetry, the molecule has no permanent dipole and is rotationally inactive. 2.3 Classifying molecular rotors Every molecule has three perpendicular principal axes of rotation, each with an associated moment of inertia. In our model, we treat atoms as point masses. For a linear molecule, this means the moment of inertia about the bond axis is exactly zero: point masses lying on the axis have no mass at any distance from it. (A real molecule has electrons distributed around the axis, which contribute a tiny moment of inertia, but this is negligible.) So when we classify molecules, the question is: how many distinct, non-zero moments of inertia does the molecule have? Classification Condition Example Linear \\(I_b = I_c\\), \\(\\;I_a = 0\\) HCN Spherical top \\(I_a = I_b = I_c\\) CH4 Symmetric top Two equal, one different (all non-zero) NH3 Asymmetric rotor All three different H2O The classification follows from the symmetry of the molecule: HCN is linear. Rotation about the two axes perpendicular to the bond axis is equivalent (both sweep out the same shape), so \\(I_b = I_c\\). In the point mass model, the moment of inertia along the bond axis (\\(I_a\\)) is exactly zero: the atoms lie on that axis, so there is no mass at any distance from it. NH3 is a triangular pyramid. The axis through the nitrogen and the centre of the hydrogen triangle is unique (the “figure axis”), while the two perpendicular axes are equivalent by the three-fold symmetry. So \\(I_b = I_c \\neq I_a\\), with all three non-zero. H2O is bent, with no equivalent axes. All three moments of inertia are different. CH4 is tetrahedral. The full symmetry makes all three axes equivalent, so \\(I_a = I_b = I_c\\). However, methane has no permanent dipole, so despite being a spherical top it has no rotational spectrum. 2.4 The rotational constant \\(B\\) The rotational constant \\(B\\) encapsulates the moment of inertia of a molecule in a form that relates directly to spectroscopic measurements. It can be expressed in three different units: \\[B \\text{ (J)} = \\frac{h^2}{8\\pi^2 I}, \\qquad B \\text{ (Hz)} = \\frac{h}{8\\pi^2 I}, \\qquad B \\text{ (cm}^{-1}\\text{)} = \\frac{h}{8\\pi^2 I c}\\] These are all the same physical quantity, just scaled differently. The joule form is \\(B\\) as an energy; the Hz and cm⁻¹ forms divide out one or both of \\(h\\) and \\(c\\). In practice, spectroscopists almost always use cm\\(^{-1}\\) (wavenumbers). Wavenumbers are proportional to energy (they are just missing a factor of \\(hc\\)), and they give conveniently sized numbers for molecular energy levels. Joules and Hz give correct but unwieldy values for molecular-scale quantities. 2.5 From energy levels to a spectrum Spectroscopy connects quantum mechanics to experiment. The rigid rotor model gives energy levels: \\[E_J = BJ(J+1)\\] where \\(J = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\) is the rotational quantum number. These energy levels are not evenly spaced: the gap between successive levels increases with \\(J\\). A spectroscopic transition happens when a molecule absorbs (or emits) a photon and moves between energy levels. Conservation of energy requires \\(h\\nu = \\Delta E\\), and the selection rule restricts us to \\(\\Delta J = +1\\) (for absorption). For a molecule starting in level \\(J\\), the transition energy is: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\Delta E &amp;= E_{J+1} - E_J \\\\ &amp;= B(J+1)(J+2) - BJ(J+1) \\\\ &amp;= B(J+1)\\big[(J+2) - J\\big] \\\\ &amp;= 2B(J+1) \\end{aligned}\\] So the allowed transitions are: Transition Energy Frequency \\(J = 0 \\to 1\\) \\(2B\\) \\(2B/h\\) \\(J = 1 \\to 2\\) \\(4B\\) \\(4B/h\\) \\(J = 2 \\to 3\\) \\(6B\\) \\(6B/h\\) \\(J = 3 \\to 4\\) \\(8B\\) \\(8B/h\\) The transition energies are \\(2B(J+1)\\), which increase linearly. The spacing between consecutive lines is always \\(2B\\). The energy levels of a rigid rotor get further apart with increasing \\(J\\), but the lines in the rotational spectrum are evenly spaced. This is because the spectrum shows transitions (\\(\\Delta E\\)), and the constant spacing is the difference between successive transition energies. 2.6 Extracting molecular properties from a rotational spectrum The physics runs in one direction: a molecule has a bond length \\(r\\), which determines its moment of inertia \\(I = \\mu r^2\\), which determines the rotational constant \\(B = h^2 / 8\\pi^2 I\\), which determines the line spacing \\(2B\\) in the spectrum. \\[r \\;\\longrightarrow\\; I = \\mu r^2 \\;\\longrightarrow\\; B = \\frac{h^2}{8\\pi^2 I} \\;\\longrightarrow\\; \\text{line spacing} = 2B\\] But every step is invertible, so we can run the chain backwards. If you measure the line spacing, you can extract \\(B\\), then \\(I\\), then \\(r\\): \\[\\text{line spacing} = 2B \\;\\longrightarrow\\; B \\;\\longrightarrow\\; I = \\frac{h^2}{8\\pi^2 B} \\;\\longrightarrow\\; r = \\sqrt{\\frac{I}{\\mu}}\\] 2.6.1 The reduced mass For a diatomic molecule, the moment of inertia is \\(I = \\mu r^2\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is the reduced mass: \\[\\mu = \\frac{m_1 \\, m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\\] The reduced mass appears because we are converting a two-body problem (two atoms orbiting their common centre of mass) into an equivalent one-body problem (a single particle of mass \\(\\mu\\) at distance \\(r\\) from the centre). This is a standard technique in physics that simplifies the mathematics without losing any information. Note that the reduced mass formula gives a result in amu if you use atomic masses in amu. For the equation \\(r = \\sqrt{I/\\mu}\\) to work, you need \\(\\mu\\) in kg (since \\(I\\) is in kg m\\(^2\\)). Convert using \\(1\\;\\text{amu} = 1.661 \\times 10^{-27}\\;\\text{kg}\\). This calculation is worth pausing over. From a set of line positions in a microwave spectrum, you can extract a bond length in picometres. Spectroscopy lets you measure molecular dimensions from the way light interacts with molecules. 2.6.2 A note on unit conversions Two common pitfalls arise in these calculations: Converting from cm\\(^{-1}\\) to joules. The conversion is \\(E = hc\\tilde{\\nu}\\). If \\(\\tilde{\\nu}\\) is in cm\\(^{-1}\\), then \\(c\\) must be in cm s\\(^{-1}\\) (\\(2.998 \\times 10^{10}\\)). Alternatively, convert \\(\\tilde{\\nu}\\) to m\\(^{-1}\\) first (multiply by 100) and use \\(c\\) in m s\\(^{-1}\\). Either approach works; mixing them introduces a factor-of-100 error. Reduced mass units. Computing \\(\\mu\\) from atomic masses in amu gives a result in amu. You must convert to kg before using \\(r = \\sqrt{I/\\mu}\\), because \\(I\\) is in kg m\\(^2\\). As a sanity check: a typical covalent bond length is 100 to 200 pm (1 to 2 , or \\(1\\)-\\(2 \\times 10^{-10}\\) m). If your answer is not in this range, look for a unit error. 2.7 Beyond the rigid rotor The rigid rotor model predicts perfectly even line spacing, and for most molecules at low \\(J\\) this is a good approximation. But real bonds are not rigid. At high \\(J\\), the molecule is spinning fast, and centrifugal force stretches the bond. This increases \\(r\\), which increases \\(I\\), which decreases \\(B\\). The effect on the energy levels is that they become closer together than the rigid rotor predicts. The direction of this shift makes physical sense from the correspondence principle: as the bond stretches, the molecule gets larger, and larger objects are closer to the classical regime where energy levels form a continuum. So we should expect the levels to get closer together at high \\(J\\), which is exactly what centrifugal distortion gives us. The effect on the spectrum is that the line spacing is no longer constant: lines get progressively closer together at higher frequency. This is accounted for by adding a correction term to the energy: \\[E_J = BJ(J+1) - DJ^2(J+1)^2\\] where \\(D\\) is the centrifugal distortion constant. For most molecules \\(D \\ll B\\), so the rigid rotor is a good starting approximation. 2.8 Isotope effects on the rotational constant The rotational constant depends on the moment of inertia, which depends on both the bond length and the reduced mass. If we assume that isotopic substitution does not change the bond length (the electronic structure is determined by the number of protons and electrons, not by the nuclear mass), then the only thing that changes between isotopologues is \\(\\mu\\). This leads to a useful insight: substituting a heavier isotope on the light atom has a much larger effect than substituting on the heavy atom. For example, in HBr: Replacing \\({}^{79}\\ce{Br}\\) with \\({}^{81}\\ce{Br}\\) changes \\(\\mu\\) by about 0.03%. The rotational spectrum is almost unaffected, and using the average atomic mass for bromine is a perfectly good approximation. Replacing \\({}^{1}\\ce{H}\\) with \\({}^{2}\\ce{H}\\) (deuterium) nearly doubles \\(\\mu\\) (from about 0.99 to 1.95 amu). This produces a dramatically different rotational spectrum. Isotope substitution on the light atom has the largest effect on the reduced mass (and therefore on \\(B\\)), because a small absolute change in mass represents a large fractional change. Going from \\({}^{1}\\ce{H}\\) to \\({}^{2}\\ce{H}\\) is a 100% increase in mass; going from \\({}^{79}\\ce{Br}\\) to \\({}^{81}\\ce{Br}\\) is only 2.5%.
